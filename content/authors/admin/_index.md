Hi! I've a degree in environmental engineering and my research interest include hydroclimatology, climate change, atmospheric dynamics and programming. I'm also a member of  IAHR-YPN Peru and the Climate Change Research Circle - UNALM. I made this blog  to document the progress of my bachelor thesis, write about some projects and improve my English writing. Have fun ! thanks.
